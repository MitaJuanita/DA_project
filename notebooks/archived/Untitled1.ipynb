    "## About Me\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello!\n",
    "\n",
    "My name is Sherminta Lawrence, and I am a Data Analyst/Interface Analyst with over 10 years of experience in hospital data analytics and EMR integration. This repository showcases my skills, projects, and progress in healthcare data analytics.\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This portfolio demonstrates an end-to-end approach to healthcare data analytics by:\n",
    "- **Designing and managing** a relational database (PostgreSQL) for healthcare data.\n",
    "- **Writing and optimizing SQL queries** to generate insights (e.g., readmission rates, common diagnoses).\n",
    "- **Performing data analysis** with Python for data validation, cleaning, visualization, and predictive modeling.\n",
    "- **Building interactive dashboards** using Power BI to communicate key findings.\n",
    "## Data Modeling & ER Diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, a robust data model forms the foundation for our healthcare analytics workflow. The model integrates key datasets—including patient vitals, hospital encounters, and prescription records—into a unified schema. This comprehensive view allows for advanced feature engineering and predictive modeling, such as forecasting readmission risk, while also supporting the creation of interactive dashboards in Power BI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Entities and Relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Patient**\n",
    "   - **Primary Key:** `Patient_ID`\n",
    "   - **Description:** Represents the core patient record. Although our current dataset focuses on clinical metrics, encounters, and prescriptions, this entity could be expanded to include demographic details.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Patient_Vitals**\n",
    "   - **Foreign Key:** `Patient_ID` (references Patient)\n",
    "   - **Attributes:** Age, Gender, Height, Weight, BMI, Temperature, Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, etc.\n",
    "   - **Relationship:** A single patient can have multiple vital sign measurements over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Encounters**\n",
    "   - **Primary Key:** `Encounter_ID`\n",
    "   - **Foreign Key:** `Patient_ID` (references Patient)\n",
    "   - **Attributes:** Admission Date, Discharge Date, Diagnosis Code, Diagnosis Description, Procedure, etc.\n",
    "   - **Relationship:** Each patient may experience multiple hospital or clinical encounters.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Patient_RX**\n",
    "   - **Foreign Key:** `Patient_ID` (references Patient)\n",
    "   - **Attributes:** Weight Loss Drug, Hypertension Drug, Diabetes Drug, Cholesterol Drug, etc.\n",
    "   - **Relationship:** This table captures the medication profile for each patient, either as a single aggregated record or as multiple entries depending on the clinical scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ER Diagram\n",
