# Project Notebooks

Welcome to my portfolio of healthcare data and integration projects. These notebooks showcase my professional experience in healthcare systems integration, data analytics, and workflow optimization. Each project demonstrates practical applications of HL7/FHIR standards, clinical data analysis, and interface engineering solutions.

## Key Focus Areas
* Healthcare data integration using HL7 and FHIR standards
* Clinical trial data analysis with SQL and Python
* Interface migration workflows between legacy and modern systems
* Real-time monitoring and validation of healthcare data streams
* Statistical analysis of patient outcomes and healthcare metrics
