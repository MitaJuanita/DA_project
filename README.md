# Mirth HL7 Interface Migration (Case Study)

### **Overview**
**Challenge:** Migrate clients from a legacy VB-based interface to a **Mirth-powered HL7 interface engine** while ensuring seamless data exchange with EMRs like **Epic Beaker, Meditech, Vista, and Cloverleaf.**

**SDLC Approach:**
- Followed **Agile methodology** with sprint-based releases.
- Participated in **backlog grooming, sprint planning, and iterative testing cycles.**
- Conducted **interface validation** using HL7 message types (ADT, ORM, ORU) to ensure compliance.
- Deployed using **parallel testing strategies** to minimize downtime.

**Solution:**
- Configured and optimized **HL7 transactions (ADT, ORM, ORU)** to align with EMR requirements.
- Developed **FHIR validation scripts** to support JSON-based patient resource exchange.
- Created SQL queries for **data validation and integrity checks** during migration.
- Designed **monitoring workflows** to track message success rates post-migration, utilizing Mirth's channel statistics and built-in dashboards.

**Outcome:**

✅ **Reduced HL7 transaction errors**, improving data reliability.  
✅ **Enhanced interoperability** with major EMRs like Epic Beaker, Meditech, and Cloverleaf.

## JavaScript for Parsing JSON in Mirth:

Here’s a generalized example of how JavaScript is used in Mirth to parse JSON patient data and create an HL7 message (with error handling).

# Data Analysis Projects 

## Features

- **Data Cleaning & Transformation** – Used SQL and Python to handle missing values, outliers, and format inconsistencies, improving data quality for analysis.
- **Predictive Modeling** – Built a logistic regression model to predict hospital readmissions, helping optimize patient care.
- **FHIR Resource Validation** – Developed Python scripts to validate HL7 FHIR patient resources against schema standards.

### **Project 1: Clinical Trial Patient List (JOIN + CASE)**
- **Objective:** Identify eligible patients for a clinical trial based on lab results and demographic data.
- **Skills Used:** SQL joins, CASE statements, filtering, and patient cohort identification.
- **Outcome:** Helped refine patient selection criteria, improving recruitment efficiency.

### **Project 2: FHIR Resource Validation Lite**
- **Objective:** Validate JSON-based FHIR patient resources against HL7 standards.
- **Skills Used:** Python, JSON parsing, schema validation, and FHIR standards.
- **Outcome:** Ensured compliance with FHIR interoperability guidelines, reducing integration errors.

### **Project 3: Predictive Modeling (In-Progress)**

**Objective:** Predict readmission rates within a 30 day period by generating features from our three data sets:

- Patient_Vitals: Capturing patient health status
- Encounters: Understanding patient visits and length of stay
- Patient_RX: Analyzing medication history
