# Healthcare Data Analytics Portfolio

## About Me

Hello! I'm **Sherminta Lawrence**, a Data & Interface Analyst with over 10 years of experience integrating and analyzing healthcare data. My expertise lies in building **HL7 interfaces, validating FHIR resources, and developing data-driven insights for hospital systems**. This repository showcases my projects demonstrating how data analytics can enhance healthcare operations and decision-making.

## Who Should Use This?

This repository is designed for:

- **Healthcare data professionals** looking for real-world examples of HL7/FHIR integration.
- **Data analysts** interested in healthcare-focused SQL and Python projects.
- **Developers & engineers** working on interoperability solutions.
- **Anyone exploring healthcare data modeling and visualization.**

## Database Schema

Below is an ER diagram representing the healthcare database structure. It models patient encounters, lab results, providers, and hospital locations.



## Features

âœ… **Data Cleaning & Transformation** â€“ Used SQL and Python to handle missing values, outliers, and format inconsistencies, improving data quality for analysis. âœ… **Predictive Modeling** â€“ Built a logistic regression model to predict hospital readmissions, helping optimize patient care. âœ… **FHIR Resource Validation** â€“ Developed Python scripts to validate HL7 FHIR patient resources against schema standards. âœ… **Dashboard Development** â€“ Created a Power BI dashboard for tracking real-time hospital performance KPIs.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming:** Python, SQL, JavaScript
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, SQL Server, SQLite
- **Healthcare Data Standards:** HL7 (ADT, ORM, ORU), FHIR (Patient Resource), JSON Validation
- **Data Processing & ETL:** Pandas, SQLAlchemy, SSIS
- **Data Visualization:** Power BI, Tableau, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Projects

### **Project 1: Clinical Trial Patient List (JOIN + CASE)**

- **Objective:** Identify eligible patients for a clinical trial based on lab results and demographic data.
- **Skills Used:** SQL joins, CASE statements, filtering, and patient cohort identification.
- **Outcome:** Helped refine patient selection criteria, improving recruitment efficiency.

### **Project 2: FHIR Resource Validation Lite**

- **Objective:** Validate JSON-based FHIR patient resources against HL7 standards.
- **Skills Used:** Python, JSON parsing, schema validation, and FHIR standards.
- **Outcome:** Ensured compliance with FHIR interoperability guidelines, reducing integration errors.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/healthcare-data-analytics.git
   ```
2. Set up the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run SQL scripts or Python files as needed for data analysis.

## Future Enhancements

- Expand FHIR validation scripts for more resources (Observations, Encounters, Medications).
- Add more interactive visualizations in Power BI and Tableau.
- Develop API integrations for real-time data exchange.
