# About ME
Hello!

My name is Sherminta Lawrence and I am a Data Analyst/Interface Analyst with over 10 years of experience in Hospital data Analytics and EMR intergration.

This is a repository to showcase my skills, projects and progress in Healthcare Data Analytics.

In my spare time, I play with all things data! I enjoy exploring the new tools and techniques to gain insight into solving complex problems or satisfying any my curiosity about the world. Data can tell a big part of a story and helps us to focus on systemic issues that can get lost in the noise.

## Overview

This project aims to demonstrate how to:

1. **Design and manage** a relational database (PostgreSQL) for healthcare data.  
2. **Control schema changes** using Flyway migrations.  
3. **Write and optimize SQL queries** to generate insights (e.g., readmission rates, common diagnoses).  
4. **Analyze data** with Pythonâ€”cleaning, visualization, and optional predictive modeling.  
5. **Build a data visualization dashboard** to communicate findings interactively (if you include Tableau or Power BI).

## Features

- **SQL Queries**: Examples of JOINs, window functions, and aggregations on patient data.  
- **Flyway Migrations**: A versioned set of scripts (`V1__init.sql`, `V2__add_encounters.sql`, etc.) for creating and updating the database schema. 
- **Python EDA & Modeling**: Jupyter notebooks showing data wrangling and exploratory analysis. Possibly a simple logistic regression for readmission prediction.
- **Python Faker**: Creation of "dummy" data sets for demonstration and training purposes
- **Dashboard**: An optional dashboard to visualize KPI trends (readmissions, length of stay, cost).  

---

## Tech Stack

- **PostgreSQL**: 14+ (database engine)  
- **Flyway**: 9+ (database schema migration tool)  
- **Python**: 3.13+ (with libraries like `pandas`, `sqlalchemy`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `faker`)
- **Tableau or Power BI**: for interactive dashboards.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Python PANDAS

Project 1: EDA + SQL

- Data: Publicly available hospital readmissions dataset.
- Tools: PostgreSQL, Python (Pandas).
- Output: SQL queries for readmission rates, plus an EDA report in Jupyter Notebook.
