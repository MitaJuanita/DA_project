        <h1>Can AI Finally Fix System Integration? Lessons from the EMR Trenches</h1>
        <time datetime="2024-03-27">March 27, 2024</time>

        <section class="intro">
            <h3>🟦 Intro: The Reality Behind Interoperability</h3>
            <p>When I worked at my last position, one of the more frustrating challenges we faced was getting EMRs to integrate cleanly with our laboratory data management system.</p>
            
            <p>On paper, it looked straightforward. Both systems supported JSON. They spoke over common protocols. Integration should've been a formality.</p>

            <p>In reality, it was a minefield that often took weeks or even months to configure:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fields didn't match, even when they had the same name.</li>
                <li>Data formats varied by system version.</li>
                <li>Some messages failed to parse without visible errors.</li>
                <li>And even when the data moved across, it often didn't <em>mean</em> the same thing on both sides.</li>
            </ul>

            <blockquote>
                <p><strong>Can AI meaningfully help solve system integration?</strong><br>
                Not in a Star Trek, sci-fi-ish sort of way, but in the "we need this to work by Monday before the surgeon scrubs for their first patient" kind of way.</p>

        <section class="pain-points">
            <h3>The Pain Points of Integration</h3>
            
            <h4>Data Formatting Issues</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>One system sends a timestamp in ISO 8601.</li>
                <li>Another expects Unix time.</li>
                <li>Some fields are booleans, others are strings that look like booleans (<code>"true"</code>, <code>"yes"</code>, <code>"1"</code>).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Message Parsing Failures</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Slight deviations in structure cause entire records to fail silently.</li>
                <li>Required fields are undocumented.</li>
                <li>Error responses are vague or missing.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Semantic Mismatch</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><code>glucose_level</code> in System A means “raw reading.”</li>
                <li><code>glucose_level</code> in System B expects a post-processed value.</li>
                <li>Same name, different meaning.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Inconsistent Schema Definitions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>JSON payloads drift with each version update.</li>
                <li>Fields are renamed without changelogs.</li>
                <li>External integrations break without notice.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Integration isn’t a one time event, it’s a continuous negotiation between systems with just enough overlap to be dangerous.</p>

        <section class="ai-helps">
            <h3>Where AI Actually Helps (Today)</h3>
            <h4>1. Schema Mapping & Field Translation</h4>
            <p>LLMs (Large Language Models) are great at mapping structures, renaming keys, and flagging mismatches.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p><em>Prompt example:</em> “Map this EMR export schema to this lab data management import schema.”</p>
            </blockquote>

            <h4>2. Message Parsing & Debugging</h4>
            <p>AI can help you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Spot missing fields</li>
                <li>Explain vague errors</li>
                <li>Suggest correct structures</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>3. Semantic Mediation (ALMOST...)</h4>
            <p>AI can bridge terminology gaps. It infers meaning, suggests transformations BUT (at least not as of this publication) <strong>never</strong> replace human validation.</p>

            <h4>4. Adapter Code & Middleware Scaffolding</h4>
            <p>AI can scaffold:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>JSON and XML converters</li>
                <li>API wrappers</li>
                <li>ETL pipelines</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It won’t be perfect, but it’ll save you hours of hours of detective work.</p>

            <h4>5. Documentation Assistance</h4>
            <p>LLMs can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Summarize API docs</li>
                <li>Write basic guides</li>
                <li>Describe payloads</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Not a substitute for technical writers but a great first pass and copy editor: typos, formatting, and grammar.</p>

        <section class="limitations">
            <h3>What AI Can't (or Shouldn't) Do</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Guarantee compliance or security</li>
                <li>Understand business specific constraints</li>
                <li>Handle every edge case</li>
                <li>Replace real world testing--most importantly!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>AI can help in building the bridge, but knowing the situation on both sides of the river is key.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="conclusion">
            <h3>Real-World Takeaway: Speed up the processes don't relinquish it</h3>
            <p>AI won’t fix your integration problems, the tech isn't there. But it can keep you from drowning in them.</p>
            <p>Use it to speed up:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Schema mapping</li>
                <li>Adapter generation</li>
                <li>Format translation</li>
                <li>Documentation</li>
            </ul>
            <p>But don’t relinquish the architecture. AI doesn’t understand what your business <em>means</em> by “status,” or whether two fields are truly equivalent.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Treat AI like a fast, slightly inexperienced 2nd year paid intern, not a senior interface analyst.</p>
            </blockquote>
        </section>

        <section class="conclusion">
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The future of integration isn't AI Agent driven, it's AI workflow driven, guided by humans to accelerate processes.</p>
