    <h1>Do You Really Need an AI Agent?</h1>

    <p>When I started planning my healthcare app, I got pulled into the "AI agent" hype vortex. It sounded amazing: intelligent software that could handle decision-making and automate complex tasks end-to-end.</p>

    <p>But the deeper I got, the more I realized that what I needed wasn’t an agent—it was a workflow.</p>

    <h2>The Confusion: Agents vs. Workflows</h2>

    <p>After watching a dozen "how to build an agent" videos and reading documentation from OpenAI and Anthropic, I noticed most of what people called "agents" were actually structured sequences of tasks—i.e., workflows.</p>

    <div class="mermaid">
      flowchart LR
      %% AI Workflow
      subgraph Workflow [AI Workflow]
        Input([Input Data])
        Step1([Data Preprocessing])
        Step2([Model Training])
        Output([Predictions])
        Input --> Step1 --> Step2 --> Output
      end

      %% AI Agent
      subgraph Agent [AI Agent Decision Process]
        Goal([Define Goal])
        Decision{Decision Point: Choose Action}
        ActionA([Perform Action A])
        ActionB([Perform Action B])
        Result([Evaluate Result])
        Goal --> Decision
        Decision --> ActionA --> Result
        Decision --> ActionB --> Result
      end

      %% Add colors to nodes
      style Input fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
      style Step1 fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
      style Step2 fill:#bfb,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
      style Output fill:#ff9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
      style Goal fill:#f99,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
      style Decision fill:#9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
      style ActionA fill:#99f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
      style ActionB fill:#99f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
      style Result fill:#fc9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    </div>

    <p><strong>Here’s how I break it down:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>AI Workflows:</strong> Predefined steps using AI tools to automate predictable, repeatable processes.</li>
      <li><strong>AI Agents:</strong> Autonomous systems that decide on steps dynamically to pursue a goal.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If your task can be mapped out in advance, you probably don’t need an agent. Just a smart workflow.</p>

    <h2>How I Decided What I Needed</h2>

    <p>My app needed help with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Data fetching and transformation</li>
      <li>Testing and debugging</li>
      <li>Basic support ticket automation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>None of those require autonomous reasoning. They require reliability, consistency, and speed—perfect for workflows.</p>

    <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Agents are powerful, but risky and harder to control.</li>
      <li>Workflows are easier to debug, deploy, and trust.</li>
      <li>Use agents only when flexibility and autonomy are <em>required</em>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Buzzwords don’t solve problems—architecture does.</strong> Know what your problem is before picking a solution that sounds fancy.</p>
