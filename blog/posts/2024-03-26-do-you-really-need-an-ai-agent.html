    <h1>Do You Really Need an AI Agent?</h1>
    <time datetime="2024-03-26">March 26, 2024</time>

    <p>When I started planning my first commercially viable app, I got pulled into the "AI agent" hype vortex. It sounded amazing: intelligent software that could automate complex tasks and make decisions on its own.</p>

    <p>But the deeper I went, the more I realized that what I actually needed wasn’t an agent. I needed a workflow.</p>

    <h2>Understanding the Confusion</h2>
    <p>After watching a dozen “build your own agent” videos and reading docs from OpenAI and Anthropic, I noticed something: most “agents” were just structured task flows—workflows with a fancy name.</p>

    <div class="mermaid">
      flowchart LR
        subgraph Workflow [AI Workflow]
          Input([Input Data])
          Step1([Data Preprocessing])
          Step2([Model Training])
          Output([Predictions])
          Input --> Step1 --> Step2 --> Output
        end

        subgraph Agent [AI Agent Decision Process]
          Goal([Define Goal])
          Decision{Choose Action}
          ActionA([Action A])
          ActionB([Action B])
          Result([Evaluate Result])
          Goal --> Decision
          Decision --> ActionA --> Result
          Decision --> ActionB --> Result
        end
    </div>

    <p><strong>Key distinction:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Workflow:</strong> Predefined steps for repeatable, predictable tasks</li>
      <li><strong>Agent:</strong> Autonomous decision-making to pursue open-ended goals</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My Use Case</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Data fetching and transformation</li>
      <li>Testing and debugging</li>
      <li>Basic customer support automation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These are structured, repetitive needs. Workflows are the right fit.</p>

    <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Agents are powerful but unpredictable</li>
      <li>Workflows are easier to manage and debug</li>
      <li>Only use agents when real autonomy is required</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Buzzwords don't solve problems. Architecture does.</strong></p>
