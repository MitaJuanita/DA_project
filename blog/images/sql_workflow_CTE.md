## üß† Conceptual Analogy
- Think of CTEs like temporary scratchpads. Each CTE holds a ‚Äúsub-result‚Äù that you‚Äôll build on.

### It‚Äôs like a pipeline:

- First, filter the data.

- Then join it with other filtered data.

- Then perform aggregation or classification.

- Each step is a clean, named unit.
